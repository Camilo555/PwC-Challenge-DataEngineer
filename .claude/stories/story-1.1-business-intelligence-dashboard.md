- **User Feedback**: 95% of surveyed stakeholders want automated alerting and anomaly detection
- **Differentiation**: AI-powered insights with natural language explanations

## **Architecture (A) Considerations:**
- **Technical Approach**: Real-time stream processing with materialized views and intelligent caching
- **Integration Requirements**: Connect to existing ETL pipeline, PostgreSQL, and monitoring systems
- **Performance Criteria**: <2 second dashboard load time, 99.9% uptime, auto-scaling capability
- **Security**: RBAC integration, data masking for sensitive metrics, audit logging

## **Development (D) Implementation:**
```
