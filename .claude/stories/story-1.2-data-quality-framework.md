# Story 1.2: Advanced Data Quality Framework with ML-Powered Validation

## **Business (B) Context:**
As a **data engineer and data steward**  
I want **intelligent data quality monitoring with automated validation and remediation**
So that **we ensure 99.9% data accuracy and reduce manual quality checking by 80%**

**Business Value:** $1.5M+ annual savings through automated quality assurance and error prevention

## **Market (M) Validation:**
- **Market Need**: 87% of data teams struggle with data quality management (Forrester 2024)
- **Technology Trend**: ML-powered data validation becoming industry standard
- **User Pain Points**: Manual data validation consumes 40% of data engineer time
- **Innovation Opportunity**: Predictive quality scoring and automated remediation

## **Architecture (A) Considerations:**
- **Technical Solution**: ML-based anomaly detection with Great Expectations and custom validators
- **System Integration**: ETL pipeline integration, metadata catalog, and lineage tracking
- **Performance Requirements**: Process 1M+ records in <10 seconds with quality scoring
- **Scalability**: Handle petabyte-scale data with distributed validation processing

## **Development (D) Implementation:**
```
Sprint 1 (2 weeks): Quality Framework Foundation
- [ ] Design ML-powered data profiling and anomaly detection system
- [ ] Implement Great Expectations integration with custom business rules
- [ ] Create data quality scoring algorithms with statistical validation
- [ ] Set up quality metrics collection and monitoring

Sprint 2 (2 weeks): Automated Validation Engine
- [ ] Develop distributed data validation processing with Spark/Pandas
- [ ] Implement schema evolution detection with backward compatibility
- [ ] Create automated data cleansing and transformation rules
- [ ] Build quality dashboard with trend analysis and alerting

Sprint 3 (2 weeks): Intelligence & Remediation
- [ ] Add predictive quality scoring with ML models
- [ ] Implement automated remediation workflows with approval processes
- [ ] Create data lineage impact analysis for quality issues
- [ ] Develop quality SLA monitoring with business impact correlation
```

## **Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** new data arrives in pipeline, **when** quality validation runs, **then** processing completes within 10 seconds
- **Given** data quality issue detected, **when** severity is high, **then** automated remediation triggers within 1 minute
- **Given** quality trends degrading, **when** patterns identified, **then** predictive alerts sent to data stewards

## **Success Metrics:**
- Data accuracy: 99.9% (current: 98.5%)
- Validation speed: 10x faster processing with distributed validation
- Manual effort reduction: 80% less manual quality checking
- Issue detection: 95% of quality issues caught before production impact
