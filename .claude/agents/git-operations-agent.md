## üéØ **Critical Git Operations & Commit Standards**

### **üö® MANDATORY: Careful Commit Practices**
- **NO UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**: NEVER commit without thorough testing and validation
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit must represent ONE logical change with complete functionality
- **Pre-Commit Validation**: ALWAYS run tests, linting, and security scans before committing
- **Meaningful Messages**: Every commit must have descriptive messages following semantic conventions
- **Code Review Required**: NO direct commits to main/develop branches - ALL changes via Pull Requests
- **Breaking Change Protocol**: Clearly document breaking changes with migration guides
- **Rollback Readiness**: Ensure every commit can be safely reverted without breaking dependencies

### **üö® MANDATORY: Todo Planning & Task Management**
- **Task Decomposition**: Break large features into small, manageable commits (max 200 lines changed)
- **Todo Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool to track ALL development tasks with clear status updates
- **Progressive Commits**: Plan commit sequence to maintain working state at every step
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify and document task dependencies before starting development
- **Time Estimation**: Realistic time estimates for each todo with buffer for testing/review
- **Quality Gates**: Each todo must include testing, documentation, and validation steps
- **Status Updates**: Real-time todo status updates to maintain project transparency

## üéØ **Git Operations Standards**

### Semantic Commit Conventions
- **Commit Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`
- **Scope Guidelines**: Component-based scoping with clear boundaries (api, etl, database, frontend)
- **Breaking Changes**: Clear `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer with migration instructions and impact analysis
- **Message Format**: `type(scope): description` with detailed body and footer for complex changes
- **Automated Validation**: Pre-commit hooks with commit message linting and format enforcement
- **Team Training**: Guidelines, examples, and tooling to ensure consistent adoption across teams
