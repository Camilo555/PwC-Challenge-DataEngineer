# ADR-002: Multi-Engine ETL Framework Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-20  
**Decision Makers:** Data Engineering Team, Architecture Committee  
**Technical Story:** [Scalable ETL Processing with Engine Selection]

## Context and Problem Statement

Our data engineering platform needs to process datasets of varying sizes efficiently:
- Small datasets (< 1GB): Fast processing with minimal overhead
- Medium datasets (1-100GB): Memory-efficient processing with good performance
- Large datasets (> 100GB): Distributed processing capabilities

Different data processing engines excel at different scales:
- **Pandas**: Excellent for small datasets, rich ecosystem, familiar API
- **Polars**: Superior memory efficiency, faster than Pandas for medium datasets
- **Spark**: Distributed processing, handles very large datasets, cluster computing

We need a unified framework that automatically selects the optimal engine based on data characteristics while providing a consistent interface.

## Decision Drivers

* **Performance**: Optimal processing speed for different data sizes
* **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize memory usage, especially for large datasets
* **Developer Experience**: Consistent API across all engines
* **Automatic Optimization**: Intelligent engine selection without manual intervention
* **Extensibility**: Easy to add new processing engines
* **Resource Management**: Efficient use of available compute resources

## Considered Options

### Option A: Single Engine (Pandas Only)
**Pros:**
- Simple implementation and maintenance
- Familiar API for most developers
- Rich ecosystem and extensive documentation

**Cons:**
- Poor performance on large datasets
- Memory limitations lead to out-of-memory errors
- Single point of failure for all processing

### Option B: Single Engine (Spark Only)
**Pros:**
- Excellent scalability for large datasets
- Distributed processing capabilities
- Industry standard for big data

**Cons:**
- Heavyweight for small datasets
- Complex setup and maintenance
- Higher latency for simple operations

### Option C: Multi-Engine Framework with Strategy Pattern
**Pros:**
- Optimal performance across all data sizes
- Automatic engine selection based on data characteristics
- Consistent interface abstracts engine complexity
- Easy to extend with new engines

**Cons:**
- Increased implementation complexity
- Multiple dependencies to maintain
- Engine-specific optimizations may be needed

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "Multi-Engine Framework with Strategy Pattern"**

We implement a multi-engine framework that automatically selects the optimal processing engine based on data size, available memory, and operation complexity.

### Architecture Components

```python
# Engine Selection Strategy
class EngineSelector:
    def select_optimal_engine(self, data_size_mb: float, 
                            available_memory_mb: float,
                            operation_complexity: str) -> EngineType:
        if data_size_mb < 1024:  # < 1GB
            return EngineType.PANDAS
        elif data_size_mb < 102400:  # < 100GB
            return EngineType.POLARS
        else:
            return EngineType.SPARK

# Unified Processing Interface
class DataFrameEngine(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def read_csv(self, path: Path) -> DataFrame:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def aggregate(self, df: DataFrame, group_by: List[str], 
                 aggregations: Dict[str, str]) -> DataFrame:
        pass
```

### Engine Selection Logic

| Data Size | Available Memory | Complexity | Selected Engine | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| < 1GB | Any | Simple | Pandas | Fastest startup, rich API |
| < 1GB | Any | Complex | Polars | Better performance for complex ops |
| 1-100GB | > 8GB | Any | Polars | Memory efficient, fast |
| 1-100GB | < 8GB | Any | Spark | Distributed processing |
| > 100GB | Any | Any | Spark | Only viable option for large data |

### Positive Consequences

* **Optimal Performance**: Each dataset processed with the most suitable engine
* **Automatic Scaling**: Seamless transition from small to large data processing
* **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal resource usage for small datasets, distributed processing for large ones
* **Consistent Interface**: Developers use the same API regardless of underlying engine
* **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new engines (DuckDB, Ray, etc.)
* **Cost Optimization**: Avoid Spark overhead for small datasets

### Negative Consequences

* **Complexity**: More code to maintain and test
* **Dependencies**: Multiple engine dependencies increase deployment size
* **Testing Overhead**: Need to test across all engines
* **Engine-Specific Bugs**: Different engines may have different behaviors

## Implementation Details

### Engine Factory Pattern

```python
class DataFrameEngineFactory:
    def create_engine(self, engine_type: EngineType, 
                     config: Dict[str, Any]) -> DataFrameEngine:
        if engine_type == EngineType.PANDAS:
            return PandasEngine(config)
        elif engine_type == EngineType.POLARS:
            return PolarsEngine(config)
        elif engine_type == EngineType.SPARK:
            return SparkEngine(config)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported engine: {engine_type}")
```

### Adaptive Query Execution

```python
class AdaptiveETLProcessor:
    def process_data(self, input_path: Path, 
                    transformations: List[Transformation]) -> DataFrame:
        # Analyze data characteristics
        data_info = self._analyze_data(input_path)
        
        # Select optimal engine
        engine_type = self.selector.select_optimal_engine(
            data_info.size_mb,
            self._get_available_memory(),
            self._assess_complexity(transformations)
        )
        
        # Create engine and process
        engine = self.factory.create_engine(engine_type, self.config)
        return engine.process(input_path, transformations)
```
