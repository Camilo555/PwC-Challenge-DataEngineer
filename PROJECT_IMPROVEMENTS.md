# Project Code Quality Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive code quality improvements made to the PwC Data Engineering Challenge project. The improvements focus on fixing critical issues, enhancing performance, and establishing better architectural patterns.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Critical Import and Dependency Issues
- **Airflow DAG Import Fixes**: Resolved circular import issues in `advanced_retail_etl_dag.py` by defining task functions locally
- **Delta Lake Dependencies**: Fixed missing `delta-spark` dependency declaration
- **Path Resolution**: Improved path handling across different operating systems
- **Module Structure**: Enhanced import paths and dependency management

### 2. Enhanced External API Client Architecture
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Properly integrated circuit breaker pattern into base API client
- **Async/Await Fixes**: Corrected async task creation in enrichment service
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- **Rate Limiting**: Improved rate limiting to respect API constraints

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Bronze Layer Ingestion**: 
  - Optimized CSV reading to process all files at once
  - Added caching for better Spark performance
  - Improved metadata generation efficiency
  - Enhanced CSV parsing with multiline support
- **Memory Management**: Better resource utilization in Spark operations
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized batch sizes for external API calls

### 4. Airflow DAG Improvements
- **Task Organization**: Better task grouping and dependency management
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced retry mechanisms and failure callbacks
- **Monitoring**: Improved logging and metrics collection
- **Data Quality**: Added comprehensive data quality monitoring
- **Configuration**: Better parameter management and environment validation

### 5. Code Quality Enhancements
- **Type Safety**: Improved type hints throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with proper logging
- **Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings and inline comments
- **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- **Configuration**: Better separation of configuration from code

## Technical Details

### External API Integration
```python
# Before: Simple request without protection
async def _make_request(self, method, endpoint, ...):
    return await session.request(...)

# After: Circuit breaker protected requests
async def _make_request(self, method, endpoint, ...):
    return await self.circuit_breaker.call(
        self._make_protected_request, method, endpoint, ...
    )
```

### Bronze Layer Performance
```python
# Before: Processing files one by one
for f in files:
    _df = spark.read.csv(str(f))
    # ... process each file individually

# After: Batch processing all files
file_paths = [str(f.resolve()) for f in files]
df = spark.read.option("multiline", True).csv(file_paths)
df.cache()  # Cache for better performance
```

### Airflow Task Organization
```python
# Before: External imports causing circular dependencies
from airflow_dags.retail_etl_dag import ingest_raw_data

# After: Local function definitions
def ingest_raw_data(**context):
    from etl.bronze.ingest_bronze import ingest_bronze
    # ... implementation
```
