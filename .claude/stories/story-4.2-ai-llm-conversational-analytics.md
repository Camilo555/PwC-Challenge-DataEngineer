    async def process_natural_language_query(
        self, 
        query: str, 
        user_context: UserContext,
        conversation_history: List[ConversationTurn]
    ) -> ConversationalResponse:
        """Process natural language business queries with AI"""
        
        # Intent recognition and query parsing
        intent = await self.parse_business_intent(query, conversation_history)
        
        # Semantic retrieval of business context
        context = await self.vector_db.semantic_search(
            query, 
            filters={"user_permissions": user_context.permissions}
        )
        
        # LLM-powered query generation and execution
        structured_query = await self.llm_orchestrator.generate_sql(
            natural_language=query,
            business_context=context,
            schema_information=self.get_schema_context()
        )
        
        # Execute query with security validation
        results = await self.execute_secure_query(structured_query, user_context)
        
        # Generate insights and explanations
        insights = await self.insight_generator.analyze_results(
            results, 
            query_intent=intent,
            business_context=context
        )
        
        return ConversationalResponse(
            answer=insights.natural_language_summary,
            data=results,
            visualizations=insights.recommended_charts,
            follow_up_questions=insights.suggested_queries,
            confidence_score=insights.confidence,
            explanation=insights.reasoning
        )
```

### **Business Intelligence Context:**
```yaml
# Business context configuration for LLM
business_intelligence_context:

    - sales_metrics:
        entities: ["revenue", "customers", "products", "regions"]
        relationships: ["customer_purchases", "product_sales", "regional_performance"]
        kpis: ["ARR", "CAC", "LTV", "churn_rate", "conversion_rate"]
        
    - operational_metrics:
        entities: ["processes", "resources", "efficiency", "costs"]
        relationships: ["resource_utilization", "process_efficiency", "cost_centers"]
        kpis: ["utilization_rate", "throughput", "cycle_time", "error_rate"]

  query_patterns:
    - trend_analysis: "Show me {metric} trends over {time_period}"
    - comparison: "Compare {metric} between {dimension1} and {dimension2}"
    - anomaly_detection: "What's unusual about {metric} in {time_period}?"
    - prediction: "Predict {metric} for {future_period} based on {factors}"

  response_templates:
    - insight: "Based on the data, {finding}. This is {significance} because {business_impact}."

```

## **Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a natural language question, **when** submitted to AI, **then** accurate business answer provided within 3 seconds
- **Given** complex analytical request, **when** processed by LLM, **then** insights include data, visualization, and business explanation
