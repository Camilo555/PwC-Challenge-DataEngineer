# ADR-001: Adoption of Clean Architecture Pattern

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team, Architecture Committee  
**Technical Story:** [Architectural Foundation for Scalable Data Engineering Platform]

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to establish a robust architectural foundation for our data engineering platform that supports:
- Complex ETL pipeline processing across multiple engines (Pandas, Polars, Spark)
- High scalability and maintainability requirements
- Clear separation between business logic, data access, and external integrations
- Support for multiple orchestration frameworks (Dagster, Airflow)
- Enterprise-grade reliability and testability

The platform requires an architecture that can evolve with changing business requirements while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.

## Decision Drivers

* **Scalability**: Support for processing datasets from MB to TB scale
* **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and separation of concerns
* **Testability**: Isolated components that can be easily unit tested
* **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (databases, external APIs, processing engines)
* **Team Collaboration**: Clear boundaries that enable parallel development
* **Enterprise Requirements**: Security, monitoring, and compliance support

## Considered Options

### Option A: Layered Architecture
**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Clear separation between presentation, business, and data layers
- Good for traditional web applications

**Cons:**
- Can lead to tight coupling between layers
- Business logic often spreads across multiple layers
- Difficult to enforce pure business rules
- Database-centric design limits flexibility

### Option B: Microservices Architecture
**Pros:**
- High scalability and independent deployment
- Technology diversity per service
- Fault isolation

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity in distributed systems
- Network latency and reliability concerns
- Data consistency challenges
- Overkill for current team size and requirements

### Option C: Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture)
**Pros:**
- Business logic isolated from external concerns
- High testability with dependency inversion
- Framework and database independence
- Clear boundaries and interfaces
- Easy to extend and modify

**Cons:**
- Initial learning curve for team
- More complex file structure
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture)"**

We adopt Clean Architecture because it provides the best balance of flexibility, testability, and maintainability for our data engineering platform.

### Implementation Structure

```
src/
├── domain/           # Business logic and entities
│   ├── entities/     # Core business objects
│   ├── interfaces/   # Repository and service contracts
│   └── validators/   # Business rule validation
├── data_access/      # Infrastructure layer
│   ├── repositories/ # Data persistence implementations
│   └── models/       # Database models and schemas
├── api/              # Application layer
│   ├── v1/routes/    # HTTP endpoints
│   └── services/     # Application services
├── external_apis/    # External integrations
├── etl/              # Data processing framework
└── core/             # Cross-cutting concerns
```

### Positive Consequences

* **Independent Business Logic**: Core business rules are isolated from frameworks and databases
* **High Testability**: Easy to unit test business logic without external dependencies
* **Framework Independence**: Can switch from FastAPI to other frameworks without affecting business logic
* **Database Independence**: Repository pattern allows switching between PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
* **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces prevent architectural violations
* **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different layers simultaneously

### Negative Consequences

* **Initial Complexity**: Requires more initial setup and understanding
* **Over-Engineering Risk**: May be overkill for simple CRUD operations
* **File Navigation**: More files and directories to navigate
* **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand dependency inversion principles

## Validation

### Success Criteria

1. **Testability**: Unit test coverage > 85% for business logic
2. **Flexibility**: Can swap database implementations without changing business logic
3. **Maintainability**: New features require changes in predictable locations
4. **Code Quality**: Clear separation prevents architectural violations

### Monitoring

- Monthly architecture review sessions
- Code review checklist enforcing architectural boundaries
- Automated tests for dependency violations
- Team feedback on development velocity

## Implementation Guidelines

### Do's

✅ **Keep business logic in domain layer**
```python
# Good: Business logic in domain entity
class Invoice:
    def calculate_total_with_tax(self, tax_rate: float) -> float:
        return self.subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
```

✅ **Use dependency inversion**
```python
# Good: Service depends on interface, not implementation
class ETLService:
    def __init__(self, repository: IDataRepository):
        self.repository = repository
```

✅ **Define clear interfaces**
```python
# Good: Abstract interface defines contract
class IDataRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def save_data(self, data: DataFrame) -> bool:
        pass
```

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't put business logic in controllers**
```python
# Bad: Business logic in API layer
@app.post("/invoices")
async def create_invoice(invoice_data: dict):
    # Complex calculation logic here - WRONG!
    total = invoice_data['amount'] * 1.21  # Tax calculation
    return {"total": total}
```

❌ **Don't import infrastructure in domain**
```python
# Bad: Domain importing external dependencies
from sqlalchemy import create_engine  # WRONG in domain layer!
```

❌ **Don't bypass interfaces**
```python
# Bad: Direct dependency on concrete implementation
class ETLService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.repository = PostgreSQLRepository()  # WRONG!
```
